# Criteria Item Discussion

> As a beginner, my website is entirely based on the video tutorial titled 'Responsive Portfolio Website From Scratch' by 'How to Become a Developer.' To meet specific requirements, I also researched different programming techniques to create a website that aligns with the criteria and reflects my personal tastes.

## Application of Concepts Taught

- ### Use of HTML tags

  > As evident in my submission files, I used numerous HTML tags to implement various parts of the website. The primary tag extensively being utilized is the `<div></div>`, which groups elements together. To which are assigned with either a unique class to apply a unique CSS styles or a class used before to maintain consistent styling.

  > The `<section></section>` tag operates on a larger scale, where it served as the main header, which I utilized it as a navigational system through hyperlinks. `<nav></nav>` is used to distinguish between a normal view and a smaller view that requires a hamburger menu.

  > All of these sections contain content such as text, implemented using paragraph `<p></p>` or header `<h1></h1>`. Often, for clickable elements, a hyperlink `<li></li>` is embedded within, redirecting users to different sections or other web pages. Most of these tags are utilized with a class or an ID, facilitating CSS selectors."

- ### Use of various CSS selectors

  > I accomplish the use of CSS selectors by first assigning a specific class or ID to an HTML tag. Subsequently, I can easily select that tag by using the same name I assigned during its creation, adding a `.` for a class or `#` for an ID. In my code, you can observe the use of `*` to universally select my entire website for any CSS styles I want to implement to the entire website. Additionally, I employed the `,` multiple selector syntax to apply styles to numerous elements, or with `  `, to become more specific by using multiple selectors to narrow it down to a specific one.

- ### Use of various CSS styles

  > "The use of CSS selectors is inherently connected to applying CSS styles, as selectors are employed to target specific parts of the website for styling. I implemented my website's design by combining various CSS styles, including `background-color`, `color`, `font-family`, and `font-size`."

- ### Use of Flexbox or Grid

  > I accomplished using Flexboxes by using `display: flex` and `flex-wrap: wrap`, along with other similar syntax, to make my website responsive to different resolution sizes of various devices and ensure its universality."

- ### Responsiveness

  > Speaking of universality, I managed to achieve responsiveness by using measurements based on the current resolution size, such as `%` and `rem`. I also set it with `@media screen and (max-width: ???px)`, with the blank representing a different resolution size, determining how I want it to appear within a specific range. I utilized `flex-wrap` to automatically move excess content to the next line for improved responsiveness.

- ### Animations & Transitions

  > I incorporated various transitions into my website to give it life. I programmed a specific CSS selector to filter HTML tags, turning them into clickable objects. When users hover over these elements, it will either move up a few of pixels and display a shadow benath it, or change the font color with an underline, or alter the background color will change to a color that complements the website's design.

  > In addition, I implemented transitions to reveal a hidden description that users can access by hovering over the elements, as demonstrated in the `Interests` section.

  > On another note, I believe that the use of animation in a personal website should be minimal. Despite this, I used animation to continuouly change the border-color of my profile-picture, a loop of blue and purple.

## Design

> I began by creating a `styles.css` file to easily manage all styles separately from the HTML file, avoiding inline styling. As mentioned earlier, the design of this website heavily draws inspiration from the provided tutorial video. I appreciate the simplicity of the website's appearance and decided to use it as a template, modifying elements to better suit my design preferences.

> Therefore, I chose to personalize the website through the use of HTML tags with classes and IDs, combined with CSS selectors to target specific elements for styling. I altered the background color of the `menu-links` to dark blue (navy) and set the text color for that header to white for better visibility. Additionally, I changed the entire page's background color to light blue. I addressed some alignment issues that I disagreed with based on the video's recommendations. Moreover, I added several navigation arrows to enhance the functionality and design of the website.

> After visually designing the website, I explored additional transitions. Now, whenever a user hovers over a specific element, it can be used for redirection.

## Content

> I achieved this criteria by compiling different information about myself to showcase on my personal website. This comprises, but is not limited to, my basic details, current educational status, past experiences, hobbies, ongoing projects, and contact information. The website is strategically organized into different sections, allowing the content to be easily comprehensible by grouping specific information that would be valuable to people. I ensured that the content presents factual information about myself and will continue to update it as time progresses.

## Creativity

> "I achieved creativity by experimenting with different styles that I had in mind and incorporating small gimmicks into my website, adding a bit of fun without compromising the formality expected from a personal website. Numerous elements can be hovered over or clicked on, resulting in changes to how the website reacts."

## Deployment

> I successfully deployed my website by following the instructions provided in the guide. Utilizing GitHub Pages, my HTML file containing my website is now accessible to anyone on the internet as long as they have the link to it.
